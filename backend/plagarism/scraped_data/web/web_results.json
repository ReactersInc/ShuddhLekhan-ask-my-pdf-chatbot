Limits are set based on the background neutron number spectrum comparing the two NMDS-II data sets with Geant4 simulations of cosmic ray muon induced neutron production, both directly by muons passing through the detector as well as by interactions in the detector from associated muon induced shower particles produced in the surrounding rock.
