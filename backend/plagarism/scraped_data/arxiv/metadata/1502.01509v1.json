  "title": "OS-level Failure Injection with SystemTap",
  "abstract": "Failure injection in distributed systems has been an important issue to\nexperiment with robust, resilient distributed systems. In order to reproduce\nreal-life conditions, parts of the application must be killed without letting\nthe operating system close the existing network communications in a \"clean\"\nway. When a process is simply killed, the OS closes them. SystemTap is a an\ninfrastructure that probes the Linux kernel's internal calls. If processes are\nkilled at kernel-level, they can be destroyed without letting the OS do\nanything else. In this paper, we present a kernel-level failure injection\nsystem based on SystemTap. We present how it can be used to implement\ndeterministic and probabilistic failure scenarios.",
