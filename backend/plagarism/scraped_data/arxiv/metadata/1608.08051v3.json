  "title": "Duplication of Windows Services",
  "abstract": "OS-level virtualization techniques virtualize system resources at the system\ncall interface, has the distinct advantage of smaller run-time resource\nrequirements as compared to HAL-level virtualization techniques, and thus forms\nan important building block for virtualizing parallel and distributed\napplications such as a HPC clusters. Because the Windows operating system puts\ncertain critical functionalities in privileged user-level system service\nprocesses, a complete OS-level virtualization solution for the Windows platform\nrequires duplication of such Windows service as Remote Procedure Call Server\nService (RPCSS). As many implementation details of the Windows system services\nare proprietary, duplicating Windows system services becomes the key technical\nchallenge for virtualizing the Windows platform at the OS level. Moreover, as a\ncore component of cloud computing, IIS web server-related services need to be\nduplicated in containers (i.e., OS-level virtual machines), but so far there is\nno such scheme. In this paper, we thoroughly identify all issues that affect\nservice duplication, and then propose the first known methodology to\nsystematically duplicate both system and ordinary Windows services. Our\nexperiments show that the methodology can duplicate a set of system and\nordinary services on different versions of Windows OS.",
