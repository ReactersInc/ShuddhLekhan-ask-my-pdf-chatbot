  "title": "Target mass corrections to parity-violating DIS",
  "abstract": "We examine the implications of several parameterizations of so-called target\nmass corrections (TMCs) for the physics of parity-violating deeply inelastic\nscattering (DIS), especially at high values of the momentum fraction x. We\nconsider the role played by perturbative corrections in alpha_S in modifying\nTMCs; we explicitly calculate these corrections at both the level of the\nindividual electroweak structure function (SF), as well as in the observables\nof parity-violating DIS. TMCs augment an inventory of previously studied\ncorrections that become sizable at low Q^2 (finite-Q^2 corrections), and we\ngive special attention to the effects that might lead to the violation of the\napproximate equality R^{gamma Z} = R^{gamma}.",
