  "title": "Isolate First, Then Share: a New OS Architecture for Datacenter\n  Computing",
  "abstract": "This paper presents the \"isolate first, then share\" OS model in which the\nprocessor cores, memory, and devices are divided up between disparate OS\ninstances and a new abstraction, subOS, is proposed to encapsulate an OS\ninstance that can be created, destroyed, and resized on-the-fly. The intuition\nis that this avoids shared kernel states between applications, which in turn\nreduces performance loss caused by contention. We decompose the OS into the\nsupervisor and several subOSes running at the same privilege level: a subOS\ndirectly manages physical resources, while the supervisor can create, destroy,\nresize a subOS on-the-fly. The supervisor and subOSes have few state sharing,\nbut fast inter-subOS communication mechanisms are provided on demand.\n  We present the first implementation, RainForest, which supports unmodified\nLinux binaries. Our comprehensive evaluation shows RainForest outperforms Linux\nwith four different kernels, LXC, and Xen in terms of worst-case and average\nperformance most of time when running a large number of benchmarks. The source\ncode is available soon.",
