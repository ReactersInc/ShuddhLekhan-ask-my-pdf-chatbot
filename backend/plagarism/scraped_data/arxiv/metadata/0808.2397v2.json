  "title": "Target mass corrections for spin-dependent structure functions in\n  collinear factorization",
  "abstract": "We derive target mass corrections (TMC) for the spin-dependent nucleon\nstructure function g1 and polarization asymmetry A1 in collinear factorization\nat leading twist. The TMCs are found to be significant for g1 at large xB, even\nat relatively high Q^2 values, but largely cancel in A1. A comparison of TMCs\nobtained from collinear factorization and from the operator product expansion\nshows that at low Q^2 the corrections drive the proton A1 in opposite\ndirections.",
