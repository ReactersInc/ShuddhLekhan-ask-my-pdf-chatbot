  "title": "Challenges and Recommendations for Preparing HPC Applications for\n  Exascale",
  "abstract": "While the HPC community is working towards the development of the first\nExaflop computer (expected around 2020), after reaching the Petaflop milestone\nin 2008 still only few HPC applications are able to fully exploit the\ncapabilities of Petaflop systems. In this paper we argue that efforts for\npreparing HPC applications for Exascale should start before such systems become\navailable. We identify challenges that need to be addressed and recommend\nsolutions in key areas of interest, including formal modeling, static analysis\nand optimization, runtime analysis and optimization, and autonomic computing.\nFurthermore, we outline a conceptual framework for porting HPC applications to\nfuture Exascale computing systems and propose steps for its implementation.",
