  "title": "The Software Garden",
  "abstract": "This paper describes a practical method of developing custom HPC software\nproducts using a store of libraries and tools independent from the OS called a\n\"garden\". All dependencies from the product to libraries of the underlying OS\ndistribution are carefully severed, isolating the package from instability due\nto system upgrades and ensuring repeatable deterministic builds on different\nflavors of Linux. The method also guarantees multiple versions of a software\nproduct may exist together and function correctly, greatly facilitating upgrade\nand rollback. The method is the first known system to expose all past software\nversions to the designer, and support deterministic single-package rollback\nwithout affecting other installed software. An application of this method for\nbuilding a high performance trading system in C++ is presented.",
