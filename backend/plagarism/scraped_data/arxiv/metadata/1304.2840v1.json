  "title": "Cross-layer Application-aware Power/Energy Management for Extreme Scale\n  Science",
  "abstract": "High Performance Computing (HPC) has evolved over the past decades into\nincreasingly complex and powerful systems. Current HPC systems consume several\nMWs of power, enough to power small towns, and are in fact soon approaching the\nlimits of the power available to them. Estimates are with the given current\ntechnology, achieving exascale will require hundreds of MW, which is not\nfeasible from multiple perspectives. Architecture and technology researchers\nare aggressively addressing this; however as past history is shown, innovation\nat these levels are not sufficient and have to be accompanied with innovations\nat higher levels (algorithms, programming, runtime, OS) to achieve the multiple\norders of magnitude reduction - i.e., a comprehensive cross-layer and\napplication-aware strategy is required. Furthermore, energy/power-efficiency\nhas to be addressed in combination with quality of solutions, performance and\nreliability and other objectives and appropriate tradeoffs are required.",
