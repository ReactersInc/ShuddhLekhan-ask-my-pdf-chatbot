  "title": "Cosmological Simulations in Exascale Era",
  "abstract": "The architecture of Exascale computing facilities, which involves millions of\nheterogeneous processing units, will deeply impact on scientific applications.\nFuture astrophysical HPC applications must be designed to make such computing\nsystems exploitable. The ExaNeSt H2020 EU-funded project aims to design and\ndevelop an exascale ready prototype based on low-energy-consumption ARM64 cores\nand FPGA accelerators. We participate to the design of the platform and to the\nvalidation of the prototype with cosmological N-body and hydrodynamical codes\nsuited to perform large-scale, high-resolution numerical simulations of cosmic\nstructures formation and evolution. We discuss our activities on astrophysical\napplications to take advantage of the underlying architecture.",
