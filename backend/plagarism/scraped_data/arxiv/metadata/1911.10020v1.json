  "title": "Challenges in fluid flow simulations using Exascale computing",
  "abstract": "In this paper, I discuss the challenges in porting hydrodynamic codes to\nfuturistic exascale HPC systems. In particular, we describe the computational\ncomplexities of finite difference method, pseudo-spectral method, and Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT). We show how global data communication among the\nprocessors brings down the efficiency of pseudo-spectral codes and FFT. It is\nargued that FFT scaling may saturate at 1/2 million processors. However, finite\ndifference and finite volume codes scale well beyond million processors, hence\nthey are likely candidates to be tried on exascale systems. The codes based on\nspectral-element and Fourier continuation, that are more accurate than finite\ndifference, could also scale well on such systems.",
