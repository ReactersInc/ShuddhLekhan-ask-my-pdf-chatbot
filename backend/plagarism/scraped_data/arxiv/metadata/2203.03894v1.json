  "title": "Towards Wafer-Scale Production of TwoDimensional Transition Metal\n  Chalcogenides",
  "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) Transition Metal Chalcogenides (TMCs) have attracted\ntremendous interest from both the scientific and technological communities due\nto their variety of properties and superior tunability through layer number,\ncomposition, and interface engineering. Wafer-scale production of 2D TMCs is\ncritical to the industrial applications of these materials. Extensive efforts\nhave been bestowed to the large-area growth of 2D TMCs through various\napproaches. In this review, recent advances in obtaining large-area 2D TMCs by\ndifferent methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), metal-organic CVD,\nphysical vapor deposition are firstly highlighted and their advantages and\ndisadvantages are also evaluated. Then strategies for the control of the\ngrains, morphology, layer number and phase to achieve controllable and uniform\nthicknesses and large crystal domains for 2D TMCs are discussed. Applications\nof large-area 2D TMCs in electronics, optoelectronics, spintronics etc. are\nalso introduced. Finally, ideas and prospects for the future developments of\nwafer-scale 2D TMCs are provided.",
