  "title": "Erd≈ës-Gallai-type results for total monochromatic connection of\n  graphs",
  "abstract": "A graph is said to be {\\it total-colored} if all the edges and the vertices\nof the graph are colored. A total-coloring of a graph is a {\\it total\nmonochromatically-connecting coloring} ({\\it TMC-coloring}, for short) if any\ntwo vertices of the graph are connected by a path whose edges and internal\nvertices have the same color. For a connected graph $G$, the {\\it total\nmonochromatic connection number}, denoted by $tmc(G)$, is defined as the\nmaximum number of colors used in a TMC-coloring of $G$. In this paper, we study\ntwo kinds of Erd\\H{o}s-Gallai-type problems for $tmc(G)$ and completely solve\nthem.",
