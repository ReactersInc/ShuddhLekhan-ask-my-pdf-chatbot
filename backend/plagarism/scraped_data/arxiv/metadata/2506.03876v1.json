  "title": "Asterinas: A Linux ABI-Compatible, Rust-Based Framekernel OS with a\n  Small and Sound TCB",
  "abstract": "How can one build a feature-rich, general-purpose, Rust-based operating\nsystem (OS) with a minimal and sound Trusted Computing Base (TCB) for memory\nsafety? Existing Rust-based OSes fall short due to their improper use of unsafe\nRust in kernel development. To address this challenge, we propose a novel OS\narchitecture called framekernel that realizes Rust's full potential to achieve\nintra-kernel privilege separation, ensuring TCB minimality and soundness. We\npresent OSTD, a streamlined framework for safe Rust OS development, and\nAsterinas, a Linux ABI-compatible framekernel OS implemented entirely in safe\nRust using OSTD. Supporting over 210 Linux system calls, Asterinas delivers\nperformance on par with Linux, while maintaining a minimized, memory-safety TCB\nof only about 14.0% of the codebase. These results underscore the practicality\nand benefits of the framekernel architecture in building safe and efficient\nOSes.",
