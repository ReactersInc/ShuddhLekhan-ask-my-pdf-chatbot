  "title": "Parton distributions in the presence of target mass corrections",
  "abstract": "We study the consistency of parton distribution functions in the presence of\ntarget mass corrections (TMCs) at low Q^2. We review the standard operator\nproduct expansion derivation of TMCs in both x and moment space, and present\nthe results in closed form for all unpolarized structure functions and their\nmoments. To avoid the unphysical region at x > 1 in the standard TMC analysis,\nwe propose an expansion of the target mass corrected structure functions order\nby order in M^2/Q^2, and assess the convergence properties of the resulting\nforms numerically.",
