  "title": "Application-Driven Exascale: The JUPITER Benchmark Suite",
  "abstract": "Benchmarks are essential in the design of modern HPC installations, as they\ndefine key aspects of system components. Beyond synthetic workloads, it is\ncrucial to include real applications that represent user requirements into\nbenchmark suites, to guarantee high usability and widespread adoption of a new\nsystem. Given the significant investments in leadership-class supercomputers of\nthe exascale era, this is even more important and necessitates alignment with a\nvision of Open Science and reproducibility. In this work, we present the\nJUPITER Benchmark Suite, which incorporates 16 applications from various\ndomains. It was designed for and used in the procurement of JUPITER, the first\nEuropean exascale supercomputer. We identify requirements and challenges and\noutline the project and software infrastructure setup. We provide descriptions\nand scalability studies of selected applications and a set of key takeaways.\nThe JUPITER Benchmark Suite is released as open source software with this work\nat https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jubench.",
