  "title": "More on total monochromatic connection of graphs",
  "abstract": "A graph is said to be {\\it total-colored} if all the edges and the vertices\nof the graph are colored. A total-coloring of a graph is a {\\it total\nmonochromatically-connecting coloring} ({\\it TMC-coloring}, for short) if any\ntwo vertices of the graph are connected by a path whose edges and internal\nvertices on the path have the same color. For a connected graph $G$, the {\\it\ntotal monochromatic connection number}, denoted by $tmc(G)$, is defined as the\nmaximum number of colors used in a TMC-coloring of $G$. Note that a\nTMC-coloring does not exist if $G$ is not connected, in which case we simply\nlet $tmc(G)=0$. In this paper, we first characterize all graphs of order $n$\nand size $m$ with $tmc(G)=3,4,5,6,m+n-2,m+n-3$ and $m+n-4$, respectively. Then\nwe determine the threshold function for a random graph to have $tmc(G)\\geq\nf(n)$, where $f(n)$ is a function satisfying $1\\leq f(n)<\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)+n$.\nFinally, we show that for a given connected graph $G$, and a positive integer\n$L$ with $L\\leq m+n$, it is NP-complete to decide whether $tmc(G)\\geq L$.",
