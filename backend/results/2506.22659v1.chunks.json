The detector system consists of a\n30 cm cube Pb-target instrumented with 60 3He neutron counters. The neutron detector system\ncalibrated with a 252Cf source yields a single particle detection efficiency of 23.2%±1.2%. During\ndata collection, the highest neutron multiplicity event observed 54 neutrons. The neutron multi-\nplicity, n, distribution, fits well to a power law k × n−p, for both the data and cosmic ray muon\ninduced neutron production in Geant4 simulations. Two DM-M interaction models were used to set\nlimits. The first, a spallation model, assumes a single proton with kinetic energy equal to the DM-M\ninteraction energy. The other, a fire-ball model assumes an annihilation between DM-M producing\npions with a limiting Hagedorn temperature. The two extreme models produce similar upper DM-M\ncross section limits over the DM mass range between 300 MeV to 100 GeV. Limits assume all the\nDM energy is deposited in the Pb-target. Spin independent limits, proportional to A−2, are at the\nlevel 10−45 cm2. Spin dependent limits, proportional to A−1, are at the level, 2 × 10−42 cm2.\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe nature of dark matter has been one of the most\nintriguing problems in fundamental physics and cosmol-\nogy. Based on the standard model of cosmology, the total\nmass-energy of the known universe contains 4.9% ordi-\nnary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy\n[1]. Although there is extensive evidence of dark matter\nin astrophysical observations, dark matter particles have\nnot been detected. Dark matter searches can use direct\nor indirect detection methods.\nPresent WIMP Dark Matter (DM) search strategies\nare focused on possible direct detection through elastic or\ninelastic scatterings on atomic nuclei, or with electrons.\nThis approach become insensitive to MDM < 10 GeV.\nThe XENON series [2], LUX [3] and SuperCDMS [4] are\nsome notable dark matter direct detection experiments.\nFor mass > 10 GeV direct detection methods [5–7] yield\nDM-nucleon cross section limits of order ∼10−46 cm2.\nIndirect DM detection refers to the search for the an-\nnihilation or decay debris from DM particles, resulting\nin detectable species, including especially gamma rays,\nneutrinos, and antimatter particles.\nAstrophysical ob-\nservations play a dominant role in current Dark Matter\nindirect detection searches.\nExamples are gamma ob-\nservations from the Cherenkov Telescope Array[8], neu-\ntrino observation from IceCube [9], and results from the\nANTARES Telescope [10].\nHowever, for low-mass dark matter particles, m <\n10 GeV , the sensitivities for DM-M or DM-DM couplings\nare poor in both current direct detection searches and in-\ndirect detection searches. This situation can be improved\nby the search for DM-M interactions observable through\n∗Corresponding Author: koltick@purdue.edu\nexcess high multiplicity neutron production in nuclear\ntargets. Even for MDM < 10 GeV DM-M annihilation\nis capable of producing large signals, >200 neutrons if\nthe energy is deposited in a Pb-target. For high energy\nparticles, a solid detector consisting of high mass num-\nber nuclei, acts similar to a solid state detector to γ-rays,\nexcept the band gap is of order ∼10 MeV. In addition,\nDM-M spin independent cross sections are proportional\nto A2 and A for spin dependent interactions, favoring a\nsimple Pb-target.\nFor these reasons we reanalyzed the Neutron Multiplic-\nity Detector System-II (NMDS-II) data sets (2001- 2003)\nfor an indirect dark matter search using a Pb-target. A\nunique feature of the data sets is the identical detector\nbeing located underground at both 583 m.w.e. and 1166\nm.w.e.. Such a placement allows a reduction in the sys-\ntematic errors by comparing the results to one another.\nIn addition, the higher level of cosmic ray induced back-\nground at the 583 m.w.e.\ndepth is used to verify the\nbackground expectations at 1166 m.w.e. depth. It is the\ndata set at 1166 m.w.e. depth that is used to set the DM\ninteraction cross section limits.\nLimits are set based on the background neutron num-\nber spectrum comparing the two NMDS-II data sets with\nGeant4 simulations of cosmic ray muon induced neutron\nproduction, both directly by muons passing through the\ndetector as well as by interactions in the detector from\nassociated muon induced shower particles produced in\nthe surrounding rock.\n2\nFIG. 1. The NMDS-II detector, consists of a 30 cm cube Pb-\ntarget surrounded by 60 3He detectors encased in polyethy-\nlene.\nThe 60 cm polyethylene cube is composed of 4 side\npanels and two cap panels. The distribution of 3He tubes is\ndisplayed using a cross-section drawing.\nII.\nTHE NMDS-II EXPERIMENT\nA.\nNeutron Detection System\nThe NMDS-II detector is an instrumented 30 cm cube\nof Pb (305 kg), which serves as the target.\nThe Pb-\ncube is surrounded by 15 cm thick polyethylene modera-\ntors, within which 60 3He proportional neutron counters,\nmodel SNM-18, produced by Maxiums Energy, are en-\ncased on all 6-sides, as shown in the Figure 1. The 3He\nproportional tubes serve as the neutron multiplicity de-\ntection system.\nEach counter measures 28.5 cm long and 1.55 cm in di-\nameter filled with a mixture of 3He (75%) and Ar(25%)\nat 4 atm pressure and operated in proportional mode\nat 1400 V. The neutron counters are arranged in top\nand bottom cap panels and 4 side panels forming the\npolyethylene box as shown in the Figure 2. The posi-\ntions of the 3He counters were chosen by Monte-Carlo\nmodeling, optimized so that neutron events occurring at\nany point in the target would be registered with almost\nthe same efficiency.\nA single neutron hit triggers the 3He counter system\nto record data for 256 µs. Each hit causes the tube to\nbe non-responsive or dead for a period of 10 µs. The\nneutron half-life in the lead target is 65 µs, resulting in\nan average of 6.47% of the total neutrons produced to be\noutside the data collection window.\nThe two neutron multiplicity data sets collected by the\nNMDS-II, at 583 m.w.e. and at 1166 m.w.e. are shown\nin Figure 3.\nFIG. 2. Cross section through the middle of the NMDS-II\ndetector showing the 3He neutron counters. The dimensions\nof the 3He tubes are not in proportion. The top and bottom\ncap panels are outlined in red. The side panels are outlined\nin orange.\nFIG. 3.\nObserved neutron multiplicity distributions at (a)\n583 m.w.e. and at (b) 1166 m.w.e. .\nB.\nEnvironmental Background Rejection\nApart from cosmic-induced neutrons, the main back-\nground in the NMDS-II experiment is radioactivity inside\nthe lead target and from the surrounding rock. Neutrons\n3\narise from two sources: i) spontaneous fission of 238U and\nii) (α, n) reactions initiated by α-particles from U or Th\ndecay [11].\nIndependent Geant4 simulations for the two processes\nwere performed to estimate the upper limit of the number\nof neutrons detected due to natural neutron radioactivity.\nThe n →2n process with threshold at En ∼7.5MeV\nand the n →3n process with threshold at En ∼16MeV\nin the lead target were included. For the spontaneous\nfission, the neutron energy spectrum is obtained from [12]\nand the number distribution of fission neutron is obtained\nfrom [13]. For (α, n) reactions, the neutron energy is set\nto be uniformly distributed from 0 to 12 MeV, taken\nfrom the upper limit of the neutron energy generated\nfrom the Be(α, n)C reaction. Doing so overestimates the\nmean neutron energy, and likewise the n →2n rate is\noverestimated.\nAt 1166 m.w.e., 157 events with 3 detected neu-\ntrons are observed during 1440 hours.\nThese includes\nelectronic noise events, natural decays, and cosmic-ray-\nproduced neutrons.\nThis observations can be used to\nset an upper limit on the contribution of natural decay\ninduced events populating the analysis sample. Assum-\ning all events with detected neutron multiplicity equal to\n3 originate from 238U fission inside the lead target, the\nsimulation yields 9 events at the detected multiplicity 4\nand 0.2 events at detected multiplicity 5. Assuming all\nevents with detected multiplicity 3 originate from (α, n)\ninside the lead target, the simulation yields less than 0.01\nevents at the detected multiplicity at 4 and less than\n0.001 events at the detected multiplicity at 5.\nThe same study was conducted for the production\nof 238U fission and (α, n) from surrounding rock, also\nmatching 157 events with 3 detected neutrons. The 238U\nfission yielded less than 0.05 events with 5 detected neu-\ntrons or more and (α, n) yielded less than 0.001 events\nwith 5 detected neutrons or more.\nIn addition, there are system-wide single-rate back-\ngrounds, including electronic noise. At 1166 m.w.e., the\nobservation rate of at least 1 neutron is ∼0.6 n/s, which\nincludes electronic noise, natural decays and cosmic ray\nproduced neutrons. This rate can be used to set an upper\nlimit on the single-rates producing false higher neutron\nmultiplicity events. If it is assumed that the number of\nevents in one time selection window, 256µs, follows a\nPoisson distribution, the probability of observed neutron\nmultiplicity at 4 or more is less than 10−6.\nWith these considerations, to ensure a pure sample\nof events whose background are only cosmic ray-induced\nneutrons, a minimum of 5 observed neutrons are required.\nIII.\nNEUTRON DETECTOR SYSTEM\nMODELING\nThe system-wide single neutron detection efficiency\nwas calibrated using a 252Cf source placed at the cen-\nter of the target and found to be 23.2%. However, the\nsystems response to 252Cf is not the response to muon\ninduced neutron production because of the difference in\ntheir energy spectra. To accurately estimate the detec-\ntion efficiency of a produced neutron, whether produced\nin the lead target or surrounding rock, a Geant4 model\ndetector was built matching the geometry of the lead tar-\nget, the polyethylene thermalizer and the arrangement of\n3He counters.\nThe 3He tubes detect neutrons through the reaction\n3He +1 n(thermal) →1 H +3 H + Q(764keV )\n(1)\nIn the Geant4 simulation, when reaction (1) is ob-\nserved, the corresponding counter is considered to gener-\nate a signal or neutron hit, without modeling the com-\nplex ion particle motion within the gas and walls of the\ntubes.\nIf the diameter of the 3He tube in the simula-\ntion is chosen to be 1.55 cm as manufactured, the av-\nerage neutron efficiency for the 252Cf spectrum is cal-\nculated to be (28.0 ± 0.1)%, which is larger than the\nmeasured result. The difference between the simulation\npredicted efficiency and the measured efficiency is due to\nthe wall effect[14]. The wall effect reduces the detection\nefficiency because either the proton or the triton or both\nstrike the detector’s cathode or the non-sensitive volume\nat the counters’ end, producing a reduced energy pulse,\nless than the Q in Equation (1). If the energy deposition\nis below the set threshold, no hits are recorded.\nThe\nwall\neffect,\nthat\nis,\nthe\nreaction\nproducts\n3He(n,p)3H occurring within one mean free path length\naway from the wall, and the set threshold are then im-\nportant parameters in calculating the system’s neutron\ndetection efficiency. The mean free path length can be\ncalculated analytically. Because the 3He tubes thresholds\nwere set close to Q, the neutron detection efficiency is re-\nduced by a geometric multiplying factor, 82%, entirely\ndue to the wall effect[15]. Correcting the 252Cf Monte\nCarlo calculated calibration efficiency yields MC(252Cf)×\nWall Effect = 0.28 ×0.82 ≈0.23, in agreement with the\nmeasured 252Cf result.\nBased on these results, the method used to calculate\nthe neutron detection efficiency was to assume a reduced\nactive 3He diameter set to 1.33 cm and record as a hit any\nobservation of reaction (1). In order to keep the amount\nof polyethylene the same, the diameter of the tube is kept\nat 1.55 cm, but the tube has an empty gap to account\nfor the wall effect and threshold setting.\nIV.\nMUON PROPAGATION TO DEPTH\nAt experimental depth the only remaining cosmic ray\nparticles left are muons and neutrinos. The rate of neu-\ntrino induced events is at least 6 orders of magnitude less\nthan muon rates. The neutron production in the lead\ntarget is the result of direct interactions of the cosmic-\nray muons with the target and secondary particle pro-\nduction by muons with the surrounding rock. Sea-level\n4\nFIG. 4. Simulated, (a) averaged secondary particle flux, (b) averaged secondary particle transverse radius and (c) averaged\nsecondary energy flux passing through transverse planes as a function of muon path length.\nmuons are propagated to a rock layer above the detec-\ntor using Geant4 to find the muon energy spectrum and\nangular distribution at depth. The simulation spectrum\nare compared to Miyake’s phenomenological estimation\nand to experimental measurement made at the mine.\nA.\nMuon Shower Equilibrium\nCosmic ray muons are capable of penetrating to signifi-\ncant depths underground. At depth, these muon produce\na myriad of particles, including photons, electrons, and\nhadrons. Other cosmic ray particles and those produced\nas the muon passes through the rock can travel only a\nshort distance, ∼2 m, in the rock. This short path length\nallows for a simplification of the neutron production mod-\neling because the full simulation does not need to start\nat sea level, but only a few meters above the detectors\nlaboratory hall.\nTo find the path length after which the muon-induced\nshowers come into equilibrium, muons with energy be-\ntween 100 GeV to 10 TeV are propagated through stan-\ndard rock composition but having density 2.85 g/cm3.\nThe reported observables are in the transverse plane to\nthe muon’s initial momentum as a function of the dis-\ntance from the muon’s entry into a 10 m thick rock layer.\nFigure 4 shows the results of the Geant4 simulation.\nAll the observables are evaluated on transverse planes to\nthe muon’s path. For all distributions, an equilibrium\nstate is achieved within ∼2 m of rock in all ranges of\nmuon energy.\nIn Figure 4 (b), the distribution is not\nzero when the thickness is zero. This effect occurs due to\nback-scatter from rock deeper along the muon’s path.\nWhile secondary particle production quickly comes\ninto equilibrium there is a concern that secondary muons\nmay have a longer attenuation length than the equilib-\nrium length of the dominating hadronic and electromag-\nnetic components.\nIf so, it would cause an additional\nmuon flux on the Pb-target beyond the sea level compo-\nnent propagated to depth. If a 2.5 GeV cutoff is used,\nequivalent to the minimum ionizing dE/dx energy loss\nof a muon passing through 4m of rock, it is found that\nsecondary muons produced by primary muons with 100\nGeV, 1 TeV, and 10 TeV, having a path length greater\nthan 4m is less than 10−5, 10−4, 10−3, allowing this sec-\nondary source of neutron production in the Pb-target to\nbe neglected.\nFrom these consideration it is concluded to start the\nfull muon shower simulation in a horizontal plane 4 m\nabove the detector’s cavern hall. Doing so captures the\neffects of (i) secondary particle production due to the\nentire mines over burden, (ii) the secondary particle con-\ntribution to neutron production in the nearby target hall\nrock, and (iii) secondary particle interactions within the\nlead target.\nB.\nMuon Propagation from Sea Level to Depth\nNo at depth experimental or analytical correlated dis-\ntributions are available. To correctly model the corre-\nlated angular and energy distribution of muons at depth,\na propagation model must be used starting with the\nknown correlated distributions at sea level [16],\ndNµ\ndEµdΩ≈\n0.14E−2.7\nµ\ncm2 s sr GeV ×\n(\n1\n1 + 1.1Eµcosθ\n115GeV\n+\n0.054\n1 + 1.1Eµcosθ\n850GeV\n)\n,\n(2)\nand propagating individual muons to depth.\nThe validity of the Geant4 propagation model will be\nchecked by (1) using Miyake’s empirical model to com-\npare separately the muon flux density and angular dis-\ntributions as a function of depth and (2) using the mine\nmuon intensity measurements as a function of depth. The\ndepth in m.w.e. is obtained from a CUPP group’s un-\npublished simulation model.\nFormula (2) is valid when muon decay is negligible\n(Eµ >100/cosθ GeV) and the curvature of the Earth\n5\nFIG. 5.\n(a) Cosmic ray muon energy and (b) angular dis-\ntributions at 571.6 m.w.e.(6504 hr) and 1154.6 m.w.e.(1440\nhr). The energy spectra are normalized to the muon number\npassing through a 30 cm x 30 cm square, equivalent to the\nsize of the top of the lead target. The two angular spectra\nare normalized to 1.\ncan be neglected (θ < 70◦). Fortunately, the two limita-\ntions do not influence the muon spectrum at 583 m.w.e.\nand 1166 m.w.e. underground. As is discussed in Ap-\npendix A, muons not suitable for formula (2) will not\npass through the thick 583 m.w.e. rock layer.\nIn the Geant4 model, muons are scattered in the stan-\ndard rock, lose energy, create shower particles, and can\nsuffer catastrophic energy loss. Standard rock with den-\nsity 2.65 g cm−3 is used in this cosmic ray propagation\nmodel because the CUPP reported depth in m.w.e. can\nbe directly converted to the depth in standard rock by\ndefinition. The muons are propagated from sea level to 4\nm above the laboratory. Only muons are tracked to save\nsimulation time. Shower particles are not tracked once\ngenerated. Finally, at depth, the muon’s new energy (E’),\nand angles (θ′ and ϕ′) are recorded, having the required\nenergy-angular correlation. The generated underground\nenergy and angular spectra are shown in Figure 5. The\nmean muon energy at 571.6 m.w.e. is 95.6 GeV and at\n1154.6 m.w.e.\nis 158.7 GeV.

At depth, for low energy muons,\nEµ <1 GeV, the µ−cross section with lead is larger than\nthe µ+ due to attraction with the nucleus. For higher\nenergy muons, Eµ >1 GeV, the cross sections is nearly\ncharge independent. This effect is displayed in Table II.\nThe average generated neutron number and the reaction\nprobability for muons incident on a 30 cm cube lead tar-\nget is also shown. The reaction probability is the proba-\nbility of generating at least one neutron.\nTo correctly take into account the effects of the muon\nflux charge ratio, the µ+ and µ−Geant4 simulation are\nseparately modeled. Only at the end of the complete sim-\nulation are they recombined using a single charge ratio\nvalue. At 583 m.w.e. depth, muons < 1 GeV require a\nminimum energy of ∼150 GeV at sea level to propagate\nto this level. Likewise at 1166 m.w.e. depth, an energy\nof ∼340 GeV is required. Because the µ+ to µ−ratio at\nthe surface between 100 GeV and 500 GeV is constant,\nthe value 1.29±0.13[19] is selected. The estimated charge\nratio for higher energy muons is less than the error of the\nselected value.\n7\nV.\nNEUTRON PRODUCTION SIMULATION\nA.\nGeant4 Model\nAll muon and secondary particle processes in the rock\nand lead are simulated with Geant4-11.01 using the\nphysics list QGSP-BERT-HP. This list was selected based\non its use for LHC experiments. In particular ATLAS\nand CMS have studied the physics performances of the\nphysics lists and converged on the use of the QGSP-\nBERT physics list as the most comprehensive and thus\nthe default [20].\nB.\nModel Simulation Universe\nThe Geant4 simulation begins full shower modeling\nstarting in a horizontal layer 4m above the laboratory\nhall. Muon generated showers are fully developed allow-\ning the shower particles to interact with the lead target\nand detector system to generate neutrons.\nThe model universe is displayed in Figure 9.\nThe\nNMDS-II detector system, is centered on the floor in-\nside a cavity (7.5m×4m×2m) surrounded by rock. The\nhorizontal thickness of each of the universe’s rock side\nwalls is 53 meters. The cavity rests on and is capped by\na 4m thick rock floor and roof. Both extend to the outer\nedges of the side walls forming a rectangular cube. The\ndimensions were chosen to assure cosmic ray muons with\nangles from 0 degree to 85.5 degree intersect the top of\nthe universe’s roof. The number of slant angle muons\npassing through the target not covered by this angular\nrange is smaller than 1 over the course of the experiment.\nThe Geant4 simulation inputs are then, (1) the muon flux\nintensity at depth, (2) the correlated muon energy and\nangular distribution at depth and finally, (3) the cosmic\nray muon charge ratio. The full simulation starting point\nis the universe’s top surface or roof, 113.5m×110m. The\ntotal number of muon events intersecting the universe’s\nroof in the experiments live times are shown in Table\nIII. The values are found using Eq. 4, Miyake’s fit to\nthe experimentally measured [18] muon flux density val-\nues, shown in Table I. In order that the simulations have\nsuperior statistics compared to the data, more than 10\ntimes the experimental statistics were simulated, also dis-\nplayed in Table III.\nC.\nFull Event Simulation Trigger\nBecause of the large size of the simulation universe\nand the corresponding low interaction rate of cosmic ray\nshowers with the experiment’s detectors, a simulation\ntrigger was developed to further reduce the required com-\nputational run time. Once the simulation located a muon\non the roof of the universe, using its initial angular pa-\nrameters the muon track was pointed at the target. The\nintersection of the muon track with a spherical surface\nTABLE III.

This virtual detector forms a MC trigger for\nwhich muons will be fully simulated as they pass through\nor nearby the target. Figure 10 illustrates the geometry\nof the model.\nFor an accurate simulation, it is critical that the event\nselection virtual detector should be given an appropri-\nate size. Otherwise, some events with neutrons detected\nwill be mis-rejected if the size is too small.\nHowever,\ncomputing time is roughly proportional to the volume of\nthe virtual detector, or R3. Too much computing time\nwill be taken if the event selection virtual detector is too\nlarge.\nTo optimize the radius of the virtual trigger detector,\n8\nFIG. 10. Illustration of the Geant4 Event Selection Virtual\nDetector, relative to the 3He detector system and Pb-target\ncentered on the cavern floor. The dimensions are not in pro-\nportion.\nsimulations were performed to study the number of de-\ntected neutrons as a function of the virtual detector ra-\ndius, ranging from 30 cm to 360 cm. In the region where\nthe neutron multiplicity exceeds 4, all curves with a ra-\ndius R ≥300 cm are indistinguishable using 10 times\nexperimental statistics, while those with R < 300 cm re-\nmain distinct from one another. Based on these results, a\nvirtual trigger detector radius of R = 300 cm was selected\nas the optimal value.\nD.\nSimulation Statistical Errors\nFinally, once a muon is accepted by the virtual trig-\nger, a full shower simulation is completed. In order to\nget the average response of the NMDS-II 3He neutron\ndetector system, the neutrons hit times on the 3He tubes\nwere re-sampled 100 times. The statistical errors for the\nsimulations detected neutron multiplicity are estimated\nusing a Bootstrapping method[21].\nVI.\nEXPERIMATAL AND SIMUALTION DATA\nANALYSIS\nA.\nThe Mechanism of Neutron Multiplicity’s\nPower Law Distribution\nWhen a high-energy muon and/or its associated shower\nparticles enters the NMDS-II lead target, a neutron cas-\ncade can be initiated. The Pb-target can be thought of\nas a many-body quantum system with the initial cascade\nparticles having been promoted to a highly excited quan-\ntum state. As the cascade or avalanche progresses, the\nlower-energy quantum states are excited until neutron\nproduction is exhausted. After each neutron emission,\nthe number of possible remaining transitions decreases,\nmaking the process irreversible and reducing the avail-\nable quantum states.\nThis cascade process closely matches a sample-space-\nreducing (SSR) process, where each step in the cascade\nnarrows the system’s future possible states. Importantly,\nSSR processes are known to naturally generate power-law\ndistributions, y ∝n−p [22], with the index remaining in-\ndependent of nuclear structure and reaction type[23]. In\nthe case of muon-induced neutron cascades, this means\nthe distribution of the number of emitted neutrons or\nthe energy released is expected to follow a power law.\nMany exponents for cascades or avalanche-like processes\nare found within a range of p ∈(0, 3). where p represents\nthe multiplicity factor of the average transition probabil-\nity at each step in the cascade.\nThe relationship between cascade processes and uni-\nversal power-law distributions is based on two fundamen-\ntal principles: the stochastic nature of transition rates\nand the exponential energy dependence of the level den-\nsity in fermionic many-body systems[23]. It is also proved\nthat the exponent index p should be 2 if the energy is\nconserved[23, 24]. However, in the case of neutron gen-\neration in lead target, the energy deposited in the lead\ntarget is not necessarily released solely through neutrons.\nAs a result, the spectrum may decay more rapidly, im-\nplying that p > 2. For instance, the exponent parameter\nvalue is 2.4 in solar neutron emissivity [25].\nFurthermore, a power-law dependence has also been\nobserved in other physics processes, such as γ-ray in-\ntensity during heavy nuclei transitions[23], as well as\nthe line intensity distribution of many-electron atoms in\nplasmas[26].\nB.\nNMDS-II Simulation and Experimental Data\nPower Law Fitting\nThe MNDS-II neutron multiplicity experimental data\nas well as Geant4 simulations results are independently\ndisplayed in Figure 11. These data are indepentently fit\nusing a two parameter power law, y = k × n−p. These\nfits are compared with data and used later for the dark\nmatter search to account for the cosmic ray background.\nAt 583 m.w.e., a multiplicative 5.6% systematic error\nat each experimental point was included and placed in\nquadrature with the statistical error. The additional er-\nror is due to deterioration of the 3He tube over the course\nof data collection. As the case with the simulation, the\ndata fit well to a power law yielding χ2/DoF = 0.72 for\n54 degrees of freedom.\nLikewise, the Geant4 simulation results fit a power-law\nwell with χ2/DoF = 1.24 at 583 m.w.e. and χ2/DoF =\n1.24 for the 1166 m.w.e..\nFor the data at 1166 m.w.e. a Maximum Likelihood\nEstimation (MLE) method is used to measure the power\nlaw parameters for the data whose neutron multiplicity is\nequal to or larger than 5 because there are only 6 points\nin the data set. In addition, the multiplicity probability\n9\nFIG. 11. The neutron multiplicity distributions (black) with\npower law fit(red).\n(a) 583 m.w.e.\ndata.\n(b) 583 m.w.e.\nsimulation.

The fit then yields p=2.13\nwith an only slightly asymmetric Gaussian shaped Like-\nlihood distribution having σRMS = 0.37.\nThe fitting and MLE results for NMDS-II experimen-\ntal data and Geant4 simulation are summarized in Table\nIV. As expected for SSR processes, the index value p,\nwithin errors, are in agreement for the Geant4 Monte\nCarlo simulations and the data. Likewise, we expect the\np value to be close to 2.4, as obtained from solar the\nneutron spectrum.\nC.\nErrors in the Simulation Model\nThe Geant4 simulation agrees with the experimental\ndata in the exponent parameter p but not in the ampli-\ntude parameter k.\nThe difference in k parameter between the Geant4 sim-\nulation and experimental data is mainly caused by the\nsystemaic error in the simulation, such as the error of\nmuon-lead cross section. However, even if there are sys-\ntematic errors in the simulations, it is not surprising that\nthe simulations and experimental data agree in p due to\nthe characteristics of the SSR process.\nThe difference in k parameter or the amplitude be-\ntween the Geant4 and FLUKA simulations is a mea-\nsure of their systematic error.\nMuon mean energy at\n583 m.w.e. is ∼95 GeV, with corresponding mean neu-\ntron production ratio Geant4/FLUKA ∼1.3 and muon\nTABLE IV.

Each curve is fit using k × n−p, however k is\nshifted to 1000, an arbitrary number, for all distributions for\ncomparison of the power law slope parameter p-values.\nmean energy at 1166 m.w.e. is ∼160 GeV, with corre-\nsponding ratio Geant4/FLUKA ∼1.4. This systematic\nerror in mean neutron number produces a larger error in\nthe amplitude parameter. This effect can be illustrated\nby scaling the neutron production by a factor α, which\nleaves the power law invariant, but significantly affects\nthe amplitude, as shown in the formula (6),\nk × (nα)−p = kα−p × n−p = k′n−p.\n(6)\nThis shows that the amplitude parameter k is too sen-\nsitive to systematic errors in the simulation, making the\ncomparison between the data and the simulation in this\nparameter unavailing.\nThe distribution of neutron multiplicity for the data\nsets and simulations is shown independently of k in Fig-\nure 12 by fixing k at an arbitrary value. If the power\nlaw index p changes as a function of depth, it is a slow\nchange.\n10\nVII.\nDARK MATTER SEARCH METHOD\nBecause it is assumed that DM-M cross sections are\nextremely small, the dark matter flux is expected to be\nindependent of depth. However, the sensitivity to DM\nneutron production is not the same at both depths. The\ncosmic ray flux is reduced by a factor of ∼7.5 at the\n1166 m.w.e level compared to the 583 m.w.e. depth. In\naddition the data collection time was 4.5 times longer at\nthe 583 m.w.e. level. Even so, if all the events collected\nat the 1166 m.w.e. level are assumed to be DM induced\nevents, only ∼3% of the events at the 583 m.w.e. level\nwould be DM matter induced events.\nDue to the much larger background at the 583 m.w.e.\nlevel the dark matter-matter search is based on neutron\nmultiplicity event data collected at 1166 m.w.e..\nIn this dark matter search, it is assumed that the cos-\nmic ray neutron multiplicity distributions have a com-\nmon power law index. A normalized probability function\nis produced consisting of the combination of the cosmic\nray induced neutron production spectrum, k ×n−p and a\nDM hadronic neutron production model spectrum SDM\nP(β; n) = (1 −β)k × n−p + βSDM(n).\n(7)\nFrom this the likelihood function is formed,\nL(β) = Πn=60\nn=5 P(β; n)D(n),\n(8)\nwhere D is the data spectrum at 1166 m.w.e. and the p\nparameter is set to the simulation value at 1166 m.w.e.\nfound in Table IV.\nThe significance θ, of any DM signal Ssig, in standard\ndeviations is,\nθ =\nSsig\np\nSsig + Bback\n= βpeak × N1166\n√N1166\n= βpeak\np\nN1166\n(9)\nwhere Bback is the cosmic ray induced background, βpeak\nis the most likely model dependent β value of the like-\nlihood function, and N1166 = 6 is the total number\nof events in the neutron multiplicity spectrum at 1166\nm.w.e..\nVIII.\nDARK MATTER MODELS\nIn this search, for simplicity it is assumed the complete\ndark matter particle’s mass-energy is deposited hadron-\nicly in the target. For example, a neutrino can transfer a\nfraction of its mass energy into hadronic energy. In this\ncase a differing model depositing an on-average-fractional\nenergy faverage merely causes a shift in the DM converted\nenergy in these simulations by an amount\nEconverted = faverage × MDM.\n(10)\nTwo extreme models are used to simulate the interac-\ntion process. A spallation model in which the DM mass\nenergy is converted into the kinetic energy of a single pro-\nton and a pion fireball model in which the net momentum\nis zero. Geant4 is used to propagate the secondary parti-\ncles, create neutrons in the target, and then follows each\nneutron for detection in the 3He tube. In the acceptance\ncalculation it is assumed dark matter - matter interac-\ntions happen at a random location inside the lead target.\nIn both the simulations and the experimental data\nanalysis a minimum of 5 observed neutrons are required\nin order to assure that radioactivity in the surround rock\nis eliminated as a source or cause of an event.\nUnlike neutron production from high-energy muon in-\nteractions with lead, hadronic neutron production from\nproton–lead or pion–lead interactions is better under-\nstood, allowing for more precise simulations. For valida-\ntion the spallation model simulation was compered to the\nNESSI(Neutron Scintillator and Silicon Detector) exper-\nimental results[27][28] in the range 1.2 GeV to 2.5 GeV.\nThe experimental neutron production and the simulation\nare in agreement at the 10% level[29].\nA.\nSpallation Model\nThe process of dark matter energy deposition in the\nlead target is modeled using a proton induced spallation\nmodel to break apart the target nuclei. In the model, the\nproton’s kinetic energy is set equal to the mass-energy of\nthe dark matter particle. The dark matter events are uni-\nformly distributed throughout the lead target, and the\nprotons’ momentum vectors are selected to be isotropic\nat their creation point. In the simulation neutron pro-\nduction is measured by the creation of an 3H particle in\nthe 3He tube.\nFor the DM simulation the resulting unnormalized neu-\ntron multiplicity events distributions are displayed in\nFigure 13 as a function of a fixed converted DM mass-\nenergy. From these simulations the acceptance for the\nspallation model is presented in Figure 14. In this model\nthe acceptance does not plateau at 1 because near the\nedges of the target the momentum of the proton can\npoint away from the target reducing the probability of\nan acceptable event.\nB.\nFireball Model\nA hadronic fireball is an intermediate state created im-\nmediately after a collision or an annihilation like process.\nTo contrast it with the spallation model the fireball is cre-\nated at rest composed completely of pions as the initial\nsecondary particles. In the simulation charge is conserved\nin the creation of pions(π0, π+, π−).\nThe pion kinetic energy, E distribution is assumed to\nfollow the Planck distribution,\ndN\nN = A ×\nE2dE\neE/kT −1\n(11)\n11\nFIG. 13. Unnormalized detected neutron multiplicity event\ndistribution at a fixed deposited DM mass-energy using the\nspallation model.\nFIG. 14. The model-dependent acceptance for DM-M inter-\nactions in the NMDS-II Detector.\nwhere dN represents the number of particles in the energy\nrange E to E + dE, A is the normalization coefficient and\nkT = 0.165 GeV [30].\nIn the acceptance calculation all the pions of a single\nevent are generated at the same point. The events are\nuniformly distributed throughout the lead target. While\neach pion momentum vector is selected isotropically, the\ntotal momentum of an event is not required to be con-\nserved. Geant4 is used to propagate the pions in the lead,\ncreating and tracking secondary particles and finally to\nregister the detection of neutrons in the 3He tubes.\nThe\nresulting\nfireball\nmodel\nneutron\nmultiplicity\nevents distributions for a fixed DM mass-energy depo-\nsition is displayed in Figure 15. Again the acceptance\ncurve is displayed in Figure 14. The acceptance plateaus\nat 1 because even near the edge of the Pb-target the\nuniform angular distribution of the pions assures some\nenergy is always moving inwards.\nFIG. 15. Unnormalized detected neutron multiplicity event\ndistribution at a fixed deposited DM mass-energy using the\nfireball model.\nIX.\nDARK MATTER SIGNAL SEARCH\nThe results of combining the cosmic ray background\nneutron multiplicity shape with the Geant4 neutron DM\ninduced multiplicity distribution shapes through the like-\nlihood function, Equations 8 and 9, are shown in Figure\n16. The search for excess neutron multiplicity production\nis conducted using the data at 1166 m.w.e. displayed in\nFigure 11. For the search, β is limited to the physical\npositive signal region [0,1] and θ is the signal significance.\nThere are mass regions in Figure 16 in both models\nfor which the most likely projection of the DM induced\nhadronic energy deposition yields zero in the likelihood\nfunction. This is most notable at high observed DM en-\nergy deposition above 20 GeV. For low energy deposition\nless than 2 GeV the detector loses its sensitivity as the\nDM matter induced neutron multiplicity events distri-\nbution shape becomes more cosmic ray like. There is a\n12\nFIG. 16. Model dependent DM signal search as a function\nof the complete conversion of the DM mass-energy. Signal in\nstandard deviations, θ verses DM converted energy.\npeak-like shape in the signal significance between 2 GeV\nto 20 GeV. The top of the peak for both models is a ap-\nproximately θ ∼1.5, corresponding to ∼4 excess events.\nThe significance is not large enough to claim a dark mat-\nter signal.\nFor both models if the DM mass energy conversion to\nhadronic energy were not a delta function the neutron\nmultiplicity events distribution will broaden in Figures\n13 and 15. In this case the acceptance is reduced as well\nas the ability to differentiate the DM shapes from the\ncosmic ray background.\nX.\nDARK MATTER CROSS SECTION UPPER\nLIMITS\nIt is assumed that DM particles are distributed uni-\nformly and are at rest, in other words, they have no an-\ngular momentum relative to the galactic center. The ve-\nlocity of the Dark Matter flux around the earth has two\ncomponents in the earth frame: the speed derived due\nto the sun about the galaxy and the motion of the earth\nrelative to the sun.\nIn this search the small variation\ncaused by the earth’s motion is discarded.\nThe number of DM particles passing through the lead\ntarget during data collection is expressed by\nNDM = ρDM × v × t × Starget\nmDM\n= 6.0 × 1016GeV\nmDM\n, (12)\nwhere\nρDM\nis\nthe\nlocal\nDM\ndensity(0.55\n±\n0.17 GeV cm−3),\nv is the rotation velocity of the\nsun(233 ± 3 km/s), t is the experiment’s live acquisition\ntime (1440 hours) and Starget is the cross section of the\nlead target(900 cm2).\nThe number of expected dark matter - matter conver-\nsion events is then given by\nNevents = NDM × NP b × σconversion\nStarget\n.\n(13)\nWhere NP b = 8.9 × 1026 for the 30 cm cubic Pb-target.\nσconversion is the cross section of dark matter interact-\ning with a nucleus converting all its mass-energy into\nhadronic-energy.\nThe model dependent 90% upper limits, β90% are\nfound by integrating the normalized asymmetric likeli-\nhood function, Equation 8, over β from zero to 90%.\nFrom these results and inverting Equation 13, the 90%\nconfidence cross section upper limits are given by\nσ90% = N1166\nβ90% × Starget\nA2 or 1 × NDM × NP b × ϵ\n(14)\nwhere ϵ is the model dependent acceptance and A is the\natomic number. Four limit cases are presented in Figure\n17. Spin dependent and independent limits based on the\nfireball and spallation models.\nFor spin-independent cross sections, the sensitivity per\nnucleon requires dividing the factor of the atomic number\nA, twice. The first factor of A is simply due to the target\nnucleon number. The second factor occurs because the\nDe Broglie wavelength of an at rest DM particle with\nmass less than 100 GeV is larger than the lead nuclear\ndimensions used as the target, meaning the dark matter\nparticles interact with the nucleus as a whole. This large\nenhancement factor is the motivation for the use of the\ninstrumented Pb-target.\nFor spin-dependent cross sections, the sensitivity per\nnucleon results in a single factor of A because the inter-\naction only take places with a single nucleon.\nFIG. 17.\nModel dependent, indirect detection search, 90%\ncross section upper limits for DM-matter interactions using\nthe NMDS-II neutron multiplicity events distribution.

The\ngreen vertical bars indicate the lower limit of muon energy\ncut-off only considering ionization energy loss at 583 m.w.e.\nThe slant angle calculated flux and experimental flux\nis in agreement in the high energy region below the muon\ncutoff energy or range, shown as a horizontal line (blue)\nin Figure 18 and listed in Table VII. The highest en-\nergy events estimated to be observed by the detector is\n∼10 TeV, limiting the slant angle to cos(θ) >0.05. The\ncurvature of the Earth was taken into account in these\ncalculations.\nFigure 18 shows the cosmic ray muon spectrum pre-\ndicted by the sea level muon density Formula (2) and\nfrom measured data [31] as a function of cosθ. cosθ is\nchosen as 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05. Only the muons\nin the part to the right of the blue bar are able to pass\nthrough the rock and propagate to 583 m.w.e..\nThus\nfrom the Figure 18, the muon flux density predicted by\nFormula (2) matches well with the experimental data.\nAlthough Formula (2) is only valid when Eµ\n>\n100/cosθ GeV and θ < 70◦, agian, muons not in this\nregion will not pass through the thick rock layer to a\ndepth of 583 m.w.e..
