      "An indirect detection search for dark matter is performed using neutron production data.",
      "The NMDS-II detector was used for 1440 hours at 1166 m.w.e. and 6504 hours at 583 m.w.e.",
      "The detector consists of a 30 cm cube Pb-target with 60 3He neutron counters.",
      "Single particle detection efficiency is 23.2% ± 1.2%.",
      "The highest neutron multiplicity event observed was 54 neutrons.",
      "Two DM-M interaction models (spallation and fireball) were used to set limits.",
      "Spin-independent limits are at the level of 10−45 cm2, and spin-dependent limits are at 2 × 10−42 cm2."
