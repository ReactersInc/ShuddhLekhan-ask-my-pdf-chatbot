HealthQoS collects network statistics via OpenFlow-enabled fog nodes and switches, assigns appropriate meter rates to incoming traffic based on QoS constraints, and prioritizes traffic based on latency and throughput requirements. Simulations using Mininet and the Ryu controller demonstrate that HealthQoS provides near-optimal results for PDR, PLR, Average Delay, and Average Jitter, achieving substantial efficiency improvements over other approaches. The model is general, flexible, and was validated in a real testbed.'}
