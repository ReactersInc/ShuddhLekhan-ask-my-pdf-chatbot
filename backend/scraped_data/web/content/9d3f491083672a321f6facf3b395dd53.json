The detector system consists of a 30 cm cube Pb-target instrumented with 60 $^3$He neutron counters. The neutron detector system calibrated with a $^{252}$Cf source yields a single particle detection efficiency of 23.2\\%$\\pm$1.2\\%. During data collection, the highest neutron multiplicity event observed 54 neutrons. The neutron multiplicity, n, distribution, fits well to a power law $k \\times n^{-p}$, for both the data and cosmic ray muon induced neutron production in Geant4 simulations. Two DM-M interaction models were used to set limits. The first, a spallation model, assumes a single proton with kinetic energy equal to the DM-M interaction energy. The other, a fire-ball model assumes an annihilation between DM-M producing pions with a limiting Hagedorn temperature. The two extreme models produce similar upper DM-M cross section limits over the DM mass range between 300 MeV to 100 GeV. Limits assume all the DM energy is deposited in the Pb-target. Spin independent limits, proportional to A$^{-2}$, are at the level ~10$^{-45}~ cm^2$. Spin dependent limits, proportional to A$^{-1}$, are at the level, $2\\times 10^{-42}~cm^2$.
