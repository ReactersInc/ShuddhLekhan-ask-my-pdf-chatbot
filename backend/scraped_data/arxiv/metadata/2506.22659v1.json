  "title": "Dark Matter Induced Neutron Production Search Limits",
  "abstract": "An independent indirect detection search for Dark Matter-Matter (DM-M)\ninteractions is undertaken to set cross section limits based on neutron\nproduction data collected by the NMDS-II detector for 1440 hours at 1166 m.w.e.\nand 6504 hours at 583 m.w.e.. The detector system consists of a 30 cm cube\nPb-target instrumented with 60 $^3$He neutron counters. The neutron detector\nsystem calibrated with a $^{252}$Cf source yields a single particle detection\nefficiency of 23.2\\%$\\pm$1.2\\%. During data collection, the highest neutron\nmultiplicity event observed 54 neutrons. The neutron multiplicity, n,\ndistribution, fits well to a power law $k \\times n^{-p}$, for both the data and\ncosmic ray muon induced neutron production in Geant4 simulations. Two DM-M\ninteraction models were used to set limits. The first, a spallation model,\nassumes a single proton with kinetic energy equal to the DM-M interaction\nenergy. The other, a fire-ball model assumes an annihilation between DM-M\nproducing pions with a limiting Hagedorn temperature. The two extreme models\nproduce similar upper DM-M cross section limits over the DM mass range between\n300 MeV to 100 GeV. Limits assume all the DM energy is deposited in the\nPb-target. Spin independent limits, proportional to A$^{-2}$, are at the level\n~10$^{-45}~ cm^2$. Spin dependent limits, proportional to A$^{-1}$, are at the\nlevel, $2\\times 10^{-42}~cm^2$.",
