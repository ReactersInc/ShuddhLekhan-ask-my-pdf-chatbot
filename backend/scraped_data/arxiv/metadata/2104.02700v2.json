  "title": "Detecting Bosonic Dark Matter with Neutron Stars",
  "abstract": "What if the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section is too small to be\ndetected by direct detection experiments? It is well known in the literature\nthat some interactions lead to dark matter-nucleon scattering cross sections\nthat can be velocity and momentum suppressed. We show that in the case of\nbosonic dark matter, neutron star spectroscopy offers a possible detection.\nFirstly, we discuss the case of scalar dark matter with scalar, pseudoscalar,\nand vector mediators. Later, we do this exercise for vector dark matter. We\nshow that, depending on the nature of dark matter and the interaction involved,\nneutron stars can improve the sensitivity on the dark matter-nucleon scattering\ncross section by orders of magnitude, representing a major step forward in the\ndark matter siege.",
