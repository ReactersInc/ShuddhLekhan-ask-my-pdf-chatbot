  "title": "Heating neutron stars with GeV dark matter",
  "abstract": "An old neutron star (NS) may capture halo dark matter (DM) and get heated up\nby the deposited kinetic energy, thus behaving like a thermal DM detector with\nsensitivity to a wide range of DM masses and a variety of DM-quark\ninteractions. Near future infrared telescopes will measure NS temperatures down\nto a few thousand Kelvin and probe NS heating by DM capture. We focus on\nGeV-mass Dirac fermion DM (which is beyond the reach of current DM direct\ndetection experiments) in scenarios in which the DM capture rate can saturate\nthe geometric limit. For concreteness, we study (1) a model that invokes dark\ndecays of the neutron to explain the neutron lifetime anomaly, and (2) a\nframework of DM coupled to quarks through a vector current portal. In the\nneutron dark decay model a NS can have a substantial DM population, so that the\nDM capture rate can reach the geometric limit through DM self-interactions even\nif the DM-neutron scattering cross section is tiny. We find NS heating to have\ngreater sensitivity than multi-pion signatures in large underground detectors\nfor the neutron dark decay model, and sub-GeV gamma-ray signatures for the\nquark vector portal model.",
