  "title": "Branch-and-Bound versus Lift-and-Project Relaxations in Combinatorial\n  Optimization",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a theoretical framework for comparing\nbranch-and-bound with classical lift-and-project hierarchies. We simplify our\nanalysis of streamlining the definition of branch-and-bound. We introduce\n\"skewed $k$-trees\" which give a hierarchy of relaxations that is incomparable\nto that of Sherali-Adams, and we show that it is much better for some\ninstances. We also give an example where lift-and-project does very well and\nbranch-and-bound does not. Finally, we study the set of branch-and-bound trees\nof height at most $k$ and effectively \"squeeze\" their effectiveness between two\nwell-known lift-and-project procedures.",
