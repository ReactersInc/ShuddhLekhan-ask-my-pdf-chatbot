# User Sessions Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds user-specific session management to the existing PDF chatbot system. Each user can now upload, manage, and interact with their own files independently while maintaining complete data isolation from other users.

## Key Changes Made

### Database Layer
The existing database schema already included proper user_id foreign keys in all necessary tables. No structural changes were required to the core tables: users, user_files, plagiarism_checks, qa_sessions, and qa_messages.

### Backend Authentication
Added JWT-based authentication system with the following components:
- `@require_auth` decorator for protecting sensitive endpoints
- JWT token validation and user context extraction
- User-specific file filtering in all database queries
- Session management with 7-day token expiry

### File Management System
Enhanced the upload and file management services:
- Modified `upload_service.py` to link files with user_id during upload
- Updated file listing endpoints to filter by authenticated user
- Maintained folder structure preservation from original uploads
- Added user-specific file access controls

### Frontend Integration
Implemented authentication-aware frontend components:
- JWT token storage and automatic inclusion in API requests
- User-specific file explorer with folder navigation
- Login/logout functionality with session persistence
- Protected routes that require authentication

## Core Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
Users authenticate via login endpoint which returns a JWT token. This token is included in the Authorization header for all subsequent requests. The backend extracts user context from the token and applies it to all database operations.

### File Storage Strategy
Files are now stored with user association in the database while maintaining the existing folder structure. The system preserves folder paths during upload and applies user-specific filtering during retrieval.

### Database Filtering
All file queries now include user_id filtering when authentication is present. This ensures complete data isolation between users while maintaining backward compatibility for legacy endpoints.

### Folder Navigation
The frontend folder navigation system works by filtering files based on their stored folder paths. Users can navigate through their folder structure and view files specific to each folder.

## Modified Files

### Backend Changes
- `controllers/auth_controller.py` - JWT token generation and validation
- `services/upload_service.py` - User-specific file association
- `controllers/dashboard/document_controller.py` - User filtering and folder navigation
- `routes/auth_routes.py` - Authentication endpoints
- `routes/document_route.py` - Protected document access

### Frontend Changes
- `utils/authFetch.js` - Automatic token inclusion in requests
- `components/Drive_view/FileExplorer.jsx` - User-specific file display
- `components/Drive_view/Sidebar.jsx` - Folder navigation
- `components/Auth/Login.jsx` - User authentication interface

## Security Implementation

### Data Isolation
Each user's data is isolated through database-level filtering. Users can only access files they have uploaded and cannot view or modify other users' content.

### File Access Control
The PDF viewing endpoint includes authorization checks to ensure users can only view files they own. File paths are validated against the user's file list before serving content.

### Token Management
JWT tokens expire after 7 days and are stored securely in localStorage. The frontend automatically handles token inclusion in all authenticated requests.

## Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality remains intact. Non-authenticated requests continue to work with global file access for legacy support. The authentication layer is additive and does not break existing workflows.

## Testing the Implementation

### User Session Flow
1. User logs in and receives JWT token
2. User uploads files which are associated with their account
3. User views only their own files in the dashboard
4. User can navigate through their folder structure
5. User logs out and session is cleared

### Cross-User Isolation
Multiple users can use the system simultaneously without seeing each other's files. Each user's session is completely isolated with proper authentication checks on all endpoints.

## Current Status

The user session implementation is complete and functional. Users can register, log in, upload files, navigate folders, and view PDFs with complete session isolation. The system maintains all original functionality while adding enterprise-level user management capabilities.
